## Submitting a pull request

To contribute code to this project, create a new [pull request](https://github.com/eartharoid/DiscordTickets/pulls). For anything other than patches (bug fixes, documentation or minor code changes that have no affect on usage), such as a new feature, please create a  [new issue](https://github.com/eartharoid/DiscordTickets/issues/new/choose) first, describing what you intend to change and why. Please ensure you update the documentation if needed.
